## Ticket Communication and IRL Application

- osTicket (and most help desk tools) support **email notifications**.
  - When tickets are updated, users receive an email copy and can respond.
- **Real-world ticket intake** may occur via:
  - Phone, chat apps, email, web form
  - In-person interaction (e.g., hallway requests)
- It's important to **create tickets for everything** for visibility and metrics.
  - Even for "quick fixes" or informal requests
